        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the industrial revolution and since the beginning of the 20th century the production and demand for new and better technology are increasing exponently. Technology have been so useful to us that it has become a part of lifestyle for the modern humans. Most recently since the beginning of the decade the popularity and the use of smartphone has increased so drasticly that almost 1 in 6 people in the earth have their own form of handheld technology that enables them to exploit the basic and fundamental technology. Like it or not technology is now a part of our lives. Just a half a century ago the technology that we hadnt even imagined have now turned into reality and been used everywhere.</p>
           
        <p>Only 10 years ago we had to use cameras for capturing vivid memories in form pictures and flims. Radios and MP3 players to entertain us with our favorite music. Phones and cell phones so we can communicate more effictively. Computers connected to internet and TV filled with entertainment. The pace of development of technology was so fast that all of the above mentioned is now available just a few touches and swipes from a magnificient glass slab stored in your pockets. If you still do not realize how technology has evolved over the time and changed our lives, try to imagine explaining a cave man how you watch cat videos in youtube through wifi in your bed in a chunk of magic glass. It's like describing a blind person a abstract and surreal painting.</p>

        <p>The technology has also greatly helped us to do our daily tasks like like paying the bills, shopping, mailing information and much more. Not only that it has also helped in many sectors such as schools, banks, goverment offices, hospitals, stations and research center by providing fast acess to usefull data and its safe storage. The tasks which required to take days to complete now can be done under minutes. No matter whare you are on the earth you can communicate to anyone through tecnology at once.  </p> 

        <p>Hence, technlogy has been the greatest achivement that has revolutionized the entire earth. Any further advancement in technology will surely be amusing and very fruitful.  </p> 
        
        <p>Since the inventions of TV, computers and smartphones the aubundance of technology has been abused by some part of the human population. The excessive use or misuse of technology have resulted in various health risks and other social factors were compromised. Problems such as addiction, cyber bullying etc rose by tremendous amount. 
        </p>  
        <p class="r">Although technology have been perfected over time and has been a great help for us there are still some flaws in human nature which exploits the negative sides of the technology.
