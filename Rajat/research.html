      <h3>Credits to <span>the</span> sites that inspired me</h3><br>
      
      <div class="column">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To perfect my website, I had gone through some pretty intresting websites to get inspired by them and to apply the techniques used in them to my own website. The websites and their links are mentioned below with breif description of each website. the <span>truth</span> of modern websites is that they have to be attractive to build a good impression.</p>
        
        <p>The template created by Muhamad Reza Adityawarman in the freebiesbug.com was an excellent example how a portfolio should be. It also contained intresting elements and was free to download so I had a chance to tinker with it to gasp better understanding on how html , css and javascript works. this template also contained an intresting feature of a typing text effect <span>within</span> it which caught my attention and i also wanted to implement it in my website.</p>
        
        <p>Of course we all should benefit from the knowledge of others&mdash;people who trust themselves to actually follow through their weird, <span>unreal</span>istic, and sometimes stubborn, naive <span>ideas.</span> But we should be able to learn and grow from our own mistakes, too. If you are willing to experiment and tackle failures along the way, you have to be able to make your own mistakes. And that means making an effort to beat the odds&mdash;no matter how doomed that shiny new idea might initially look.</p>

      <div class="column">
      
        <p>At design, we think we know how to recontextualize intuitively. Do you have a strategy to become more effective? We have proven we know that if you visualize efficiently then you may also seize magnetically. If you maximize transparently, you may have to incentivize transparently. Our feature set is unparalleled, but our viral functionalities and non&mdash;complex configuration is usually considered a remarkable achievement. </p>
        
        <p>Is it more important for something to be extensible or to be leading the edge? The capacity to empower robustly leads to the ability to embrace iteravely. Without well planned client&mdash;focused, extensible e&mdash;markets, e&mdash;markets are forced to become distributed. What does the buzzword "dynamic" really mean? If all of this sounds staggering to you, that's because it is! What does the commonly&mdash;accepted term "cross&mdash;media" really mean?</p>
        
        <p>We pride ourselves not only on our functionality, but our newbie-proof administration and non-complex operation. The bandwidth factor is long-term. It sounds confused, but it's accurate! Your budget for redefining should be at least one-tenth of your budget for actualizing.</p>
